## 📌 Course Description
This course covers the essential principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) using Java. It focuses on applying OOP concepts to solve real-life problems, using a modern IDE for development, and working effectively with key language libraries such as exceptions, threads, collections, and generics. The course begins with basic syntax and gradually introduces OOP features, including data types, variables, operators, classes and objects, inheritance, abstraction, exception handling, multithreading, file handling, tokenization, networking, input/output streams, and advanced library components.
